# Analytical Tools

People talk about artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) or natural language processing (NLP),
but what specifically can these tools be used for?

This guide will clarify how we use those concepts at STSI by listing specific analytical tasks and how AI is used to accomplish it.

## Scrape text from the web

__skill level__ Beginner

Most NLP tasks will require plain text files as input.
While there is a lot of text out in the internet, it is not in a useful form.
It has headers, navigation bars, ads, social links, scripts and dozens of other "extra" elements.

Scraping text into a useful form is the first job for any analysis.

### Goals

1. Extract useful text from web pages "in the wild".

### Tools

1. [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - A navigator for an HTML document

### Examples

```python
import io
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Get the HTML page
r = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper')

soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, "html.parser")

# The string that goes in `soup.select` will be specific to each web page
# It can be found by right-clicking on the main text and choosing "Inspect"
# to get the style path
for section in soup.select('div.mw-parser-output p'):
    print(section.get_text())
```

## Extract text from a PDF

__skill level__ Beginner

Besides HTML pages, a lot of text is available in PDF form.
Rather than "select all, copy and paste" using a PDF reader, it would be better to use an automated script to pull out the text.

Note: This technique will not work if the PDF is based on scanned images.  Extracting text from an image is covered in the next section.

### Goals

1. Extract plain text from a PDF file

### Tools

1. [PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) - A python package for navigating PDF documents

### Examples

```python
import PyPDF2
 
pdfName = 'path/to/some.pdf'
read_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdfName)
 
for i in range(read_pdf.getNumPages()):
    page = read_pdf.getPage(i)
    content = page.extractText()
    print(i, content)
```

## Extract text from an image

__skill level__ Beginner to Advanced

Optical character recognition (OCR) has been around a long time.
Early on it worked "well enough" to be useful, but not 100% reliable.
Its accuracy was eventually improved by using machine learning to train models.

Today, a fairly accurate, open source OCR engine is available to anyone through Tesseract.

### Goals

1. Extract useful text from an image

### Tools

1. [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) - The OCR engine
1. [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) - A library for reading images
1. [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) - A wrapper for Tesseract

### Example 1 - Extract text from an image file 

```python
import os

import PIL
import pytesseract

image = PIL.Image.open(local_file)

print(pytesseract.image_to_string(image))
```

### Example 2 - Extract text from a PDF image

```python
import PyPDF2
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

pdfName = 'path/to/some.pdf'
read_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdfName)
page = read_pdf.getPage(0)
xObject = page['/Resources']['/XObject'].getObject()

for obj in xObject:
    if xObject[obj]['/Subtype'] == '/Image':
        size = (xObject[obj]['/Width'], xObject[obj]['/Height'])
        data = xObject[obj].getData()
        if xObject[obj]['/ColorSpace'] == '/DeviceRGB':
            mode = "RGB"
        else:
            mode = "P"
        image = Image.frombytes(mode, size, data)
        print(pytesseract.image_to_string(image))
```

## Cleaning text

__skill level__ Beginner to Intermediate

Computers are fast, but not that smart.
Some processes will go faster, or yield better results if they are fed prepared data.

### Goals

1. Convert text to ASCII.  This can be as simple as removing "smart quotes" from a Word document
1. Convert text to lowercase
1. Remove punctuation
1. Remove excess whitespace
1. Remove stopwords

### Tools

1. [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) - An open-source NLP toolkit
1. [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) - The original NLP toolkit started at Stanford University

### Examples

1. https://github.com/susanli2016/NLP-with-Python/blob/master/Cleaning%20Text.ipynb
1. https://github.com/STSILABS/uscis-bdso-demo/blob/issue-3/jupyter/src/toolkit/to_sentences.py

## Tagging the words of a document

__skill level__ Beginner

The first step in any NLP process is figuring out the parts of speech in every sentence.
This process is known as [tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging).
Tagging figures out whether a specific word is a noun or a verb (or adjective or adverb).

This process is never 100% correct, but the available open source engines do a reasonable job on standard text.

### Goals

1. Determine the part of speech for every word in a document

### Tools

1. [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) - An open-source NLP toolkit
1. [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) - The original NLP toolkit started at Stanford University

### Examples

```python
import io
import spacy

# Load a previous trained-model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Open a text file
with io.open(infile, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    raw = f.read()

# Process the raw text into a document
doc = nlp(raw)

for token in doc:
    print("Word:", token.text, "Part of Speech:" token.pos_)

```

## Reduce similar strings into a common form

__skill level__ Beginner to Intermediate

Is "NY Yankees" the same as "New York Yankees"? 
A sports fan would think so, but a computer wouldn't.
Similar to the "cleaning" process above, finding the "canonical form" will improve the speed an accuracy of the text mining.

### Goals

1. Take a list of phrases and create a mapping to their canonical form
1. Find [lemmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)#Lexicography)
1. Apply [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)

### Tools

1. [Fuzzy Wuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) - A library built by SeatGeek for this scenario
