# Product Management in Government

## Government vs. Commercial Context

Product Management is a well-established role in commercial product companies. While roles like engineering and design can be highly similar disciplines in commercial vs. government, product management has some more fundamental differences.

## Baseline Materials

There are many reference sources for product management. The book [Inspired](https://svpg.com/inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love/) published by the [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://svpg.com) is a useful reference we have used. It does a nice job of laying out the role of a successful Product Manager, and how different disciplines such as engineering and design work together to make a great product team.
