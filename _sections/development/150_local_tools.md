title: Local Tools
---

To work with your code you need several tools on your workstation (unless you are using something like AWS Cloud9). This section has a starter list.

### Key Concepts

**Editor:** You need a way to browse and edit the codebase. Atom or VSCode are capable, free editors. Some use terminal-based tools such as Vim.

**Terminal:** You need to be able to run commands to build or run the app locally. This is done from the command line. Most operating systems have built-in terminals, but you can also install others (iterm2 for Mac, git bash for Windows, etc.).

### The STSI Way

Local developer tools are generally a matter of preference. There is no standard.

 * Some tools have configuration or data files (e.g. `.idea`). If so, make sure these are in the `.gitignore` file to avoid cluttering the repo with those files.
