title: Bid/No-bid
---

To make the bid/no-bid decision, we need to determine if the opportunity has the potential to pay off compared to the necessary effort.

The value of an opportunity is based on the __expected value calculation__ (probability x estimated value) rather than simply the _probability to win_.

## Bid Checklist

- [ ] __Re-validation__: Update the validation checklist with any new information.

- [ ] __Probability to Win__: Based on the competitive landscape, what are our chances (<5%, 10-25%, 50%, 75+%)?

- [ ] __Value__: How much is it worth to us if we win?
  - _Expected profit:_ consider both the estimated revenue, as well as potential profit margin (usually rate structure/rate competitiveness)
  - _Growth potential:_ is this the foot in the door for a new client, or an opportunity with substantial likelihood of follow-on work?
  - _Prime/Sub:_ prime opportunities (including CTA member, JV member) are far more attractive than work as a sub.

- [ ] __Effort__: What will it cost us in terms of time, focus, energy, etc.
  - Are there parallel efforts going on competing for resources?
  - Will we need to spend money on external consultants to get it done?
