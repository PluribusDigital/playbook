title: Opportunity Funnel
---

The below diagram outlines how we track opportunities. This is broken down into 3 major states for a given opportunity, along with actions taken to move opportunities to the next state.

* __Identify:__ A new opportunity comes to our attention and begins to be tracked at a high-level.

  * _Validate_ identified opportunities to determine if they are worth pursuing.
  
  * _Reject_ opportunities that are clearly a poor fit from validation.

  * _Hold_ opportunities for which we don't have enough information to properly validate, and revisit them after a time period (usually 3-6 months).

* __Pursue:__ After validating that the opportunity is a strong enough fit, we decide to invest the effort to prepare for and shape the opportunity.

  * Form or seek a team.

  * Market to the relevant customer stakeholders.

  * Research customer needs.

  * When the RFP is released, come to a bid/no-bid decision.

* __Bid:__ When an opportunity has an active RFP (or perhaps draft RFP with a high-confidence schedule), it goes into an active state of preparing the proposal.

  * Carry out the [propsal development process](/topics/proposal.html).
