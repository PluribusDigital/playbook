We research opportunities and validate them against set criteria in order to aid the decision to Pursue or Bid.

### Process

1. _Score_ the opportunity as best we can against the validation criteria.
2. _Note the confidence_ of our rating (based on how good our intel is).
3. _Create and assign actions_ if the opportunity is potentially a strong fit but we have information gaps that can be filled by proactive research.
