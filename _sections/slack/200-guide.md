### Setting up Slack 

STSI’s slack url is https://stsiinc.slack.com  

There are a few ways to access slack. Find the combination that works for you, but it is recommended to make sure all 3 are available to you. 

#### Desktop Application 

Recommendation: use this as primary access to slack. 

* Install the desktop application (see slack.com for specific instructions). 

* Add the STSI team ( https://stsiinc.slack.com ) on your desktop slack app. (Note: you can have multiple slack teams in the one client) 

* Follow any instructions for logging in, etc. 

* Configure notification preferences. Recommend only opting for desktop notifications on direct message, if at all. 

* Optional: add slack to startup applications (varies by operating system) so that it starts automatically on computer startup. Otherwise, you have to be in the habit of opening slack. 

#### Mobile/Tablet Application 

Recommendation: Install on your phone, and tune app notification settings to preference. 

* Install the mobile application from your app store (iOS/Android) 

* Configure notifications: Recommend only opting for notifications on direct message/mention.  

#### Web Browser 

* Recommendation: Only use this as a backup (e.g. when you are using a secondary computer) 

* You can access slack within a web browser by going to https://stsiinc.slack.com. This works OK, and is great for a guest computer or less frequently used computer. 

### What Should be in Slack? 

Slack is a great forum for chat and group conversations, but has definite sweet spots and some really poor uses. It doesn’t replace email or texting, but does replace bad emails. 

Slack is good for a stream of conversation so that people can be aware of what is going on. It is also good for direct message conversations for quick question/answer, particularly where this is some back and forth. Generally good for replacing “dropping by your office” type of online conversations – generally stuff you don’t care about preserving and is clutter in email. 

Some examples of GOOD Slack usage: 

* Team chatter on status and FYI type content (“I’m shifting from working on X to Y task.”) This is good because it is useful in the moment, and allows people to see what you’re up to, but they don’t care about it in a week or so. 

* Quick questions. (“@tom how do I archive my email”). This is good because there might be some back and forth, but not necessarily a thread you want to preserve via email.  

* Send a message to the #general channel: “@here Ordering lunch from Jimmy Johns. Give me your order by 11:30 if you want something”. This is good because we don’t need emails and no one will care about the info once the order is done. 

* Back-channel text chat on direct message during a conference call. 

Examples of BAD Slack usage: 

* Formal approval (don’t count on slack being archived). Use email. 

* Long-form text. Use an email or maybe a document. 

* Storing/referencing documents. Use a file store (box/onedrive) and link to it from slack. 

### Channels, Messaging, etc. 

#### Direct Messages 

You can communicate to one person or a group via private direct messages. This is equivalent to a text message, email, or a one-on-one closed-door discussion. Only those directly involved can see the message. 

#### Using Channels 

Channels are visible to a group – either the entire organization or a controlled subset.  

* General Channel: this is very public. Think of it as the “lobby” area. Any employee and/or guest user can see what goes on here. It is intended for broad announcements or chatter with no expectation of privacy. An example might be announcing: “working from home for morning due to appointment”. 

* Other Public Channels: These are similarly public and potentially accessible by just about anyone who is part of the STSI slack. This is great for public conversations around some topic. 

* Private Channels: Private channels (with a padlock icon ) are only visible to invited members. This is good for controlling access to a specific topical channel, e.g. a proposal. 

* “@” Mentions: You can mention a person in a channel discussion (e.g. “@benmorris did you have a chance to review the doc?”) to call their attention to the discussion (generally triggering a notification to the person). This does NOT make it a private message. 

#### Threads 

The reply/thread feature is great to branch off on a sub-discussion within a channel, such as direct answers to questions. 

### Creating/Archiving Channels 

You should create a channel any time it is worth organizing a stream of discussion around a topic. If the channel runs its course, please archive it. 

### Managing Notifications 

You can get push notifications on your phone or computer. This is great, but becomes annoying quickly if you make your settings too liberal. A reasonable approach is to enable push notifications on a mobile device for direct mentions (@ mention or direct message), and maybe the same on the desktop app. Slack is pretty smart about not bugging you on your phone if you are logged in on the desktop… and sending you an email notification if you are not logged in to anything.  

Find what works for you. 

### Expectations for being online 

You should generally be available on slack when you are available on email. It is OK to have times of the day where you don’t respond instantly. You should turn off phone notifications when on vacation. It’s good to have boundaries. 

It’s also OK to have limited notifications, where it might take you a bit to respond to a DM. Obviously, it depends what’s going on. If it is an emergency, people can always follow up with phone/text/etc. 

### Inviting People 

Only certain users can invite people. In general, it should be the IT manager (Tom H).

#### STSI Employees 

Any STSI employees can be added to Slack via self-signup (using a company email address). Channel owners can decide who should be in private channels. 

#### Non-Employees 

We can (and have) invite outside guests. For example, a proposal team might benefit from a slack channel. Please do so with appropriate care in terms of the privileges of the user, and be sure to remove them when the need is complete. 

Contact the helpdesk (helpdesk@stsiinc.com) to initiate inviting non-employees.
