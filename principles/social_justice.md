# Social Justice Roadmap
The United Nations declared February 20 as the [World Day of Social Justice](https://www.un.org/en/observances/social-justice-day). The 2021 theme is “A Call for Social Justice in the Digital Economy.” As such, we should reflect on how our digital services company can actively work toward social justice.

Our society has always strived to offer liberty and justice for all but has struggled to deliver on that promise. In particular, “for all” has often left out women, people of color, LGBTQ, many immigrant communities, and other marginalized groups. Pluribus Digital can play an active role in making progress toward social justice. 

We have a moral obligation to do what we can to help address issues of systemic racism, sexism, or other similar issues. Beyond this moral imperative, there are benefits to the company to take action. The better we align our resources toward impactful actions, the greater impact we have. 

We are in the services business. Our ability to deliver depends on recruiting and retaining talented people. A diverse culture attracts talented people of all backgrounds. The market for tech talent is competitive. By increasing our reach to a diverse set of people and foster an inclusive culture that allows all people to contribute fully, we win as a company. Furthermore, we believe our employees, our customers, and our community benefit when we take meaningful action toward diversity and inclusion. 

We offer the following roadmap for where we are headed, holding ourselves accountable with the levers at our disposal. 

## Specific Actions for Our Company
_Hiring, pay, and growth:_ We control who we hire, what we pay them, and how we invest in their growth. 

*	Recruit from sources that reflect a diverse population.
    * We hire few entry-level staff, but to the extent we do, we can ensure outreach to sources such as historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
    * Reach out to organizations of minority or female tech professionals - for example, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) careers board – to reach potentially more senior members.
    * Establish a path to employment through paid internships and apprenticeships.
*	Invite diversity in recruiting communications.
    * Write inclusive, inviting job openings that don’t discourage people of certain backgrounds.
*	Avoid bias in interviews.
    * Train interviewers on implicit bias and related considerations.
    * Structure interview process, scorecards, and tools to guard against bias.
*	Evaluate pay equity. 
    * When determining initial pay, compare the experience and skill level to verify that the pay is in line with peers, even if the person is not asking for higher rates.
    * Analyze pay across employees when determining pay increases to validate that pay is not skewed to underpay any groups.

_Employee support:_ We provide resources for individuals and shape our culture to foster a welcoming, supportive environment where all people can thrive.
*	Proactively nurture an inclusive culture.
    * Provide D&I training to employees.
    * Actively listen to employees through multiple feedback channels.
    * Find opportunities to highlight the breadth of staff backgrounds.
*	Provide resources to help individuals succeed.
    * Provide mentoring support.
    * Train our staff including our leadership.
    * Ensure employee accommodations are available to those facing hurdles to do their job effectively.
*	Provide benefits that cater to all.    
    * Regardless of the size and structure of your family.
    * Verify how health insurance coverage adequately supports transgender employees.
    * Ensure that adequate mental health resources are available to employees as part of insurance and wellness programs.

_Industry-related community involvement:_ We must be a good industry citizen to support communities that are critical networks for underrepresented people to get into and stay in tech. 
*	Encourage involvement in communities.
*	Provide material support to communities.

_Customer selection:_ We will work with customers that are part of the solution, or at least are not part of the problem.
*	Prioritize opportunities and missions that by some means support social justice.
*	Do not do work for missions that run counter to or that hinder social justice.

_Symbolic leadership:_ Use our platform to raise issues and advocate for justice.
*	Make public statements where we have something meaningful to say.
*	Make demonstrative contributions to charities or similar orgs.
*	Modeling inclusion and setting expectations with all leaders in the organization.
