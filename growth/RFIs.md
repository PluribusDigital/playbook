# RFI Response Guide

The government often uses Request for Information (RFI) mechanism to solicit input from industry on an upcoming procurement. When and how to respond to RFIs requires some judgement calls. 

**RFIs are too often a Waste of time.** The default stance is to not respond to an RFI. They are notorious as a general rule (not true of all agencies or procurement shops) for vendors putting in effort to assemble responses which only go into a "black hole" without any response from the goverment. That isn't always true, and the below are some reasons to respond.

## Market to the Agency

*Sending an RFI in and of itself is a poor way to market to an agency*, but it can be a valid starting point. The approach is valid if an RFI response is complemented by follow up and discussion with customer stakeholders to gain insight and let the customer know about our capabilities. 

## Get an RFP Invite

Some procurement shops use RFI responses to form an invite list for the final RFP. These typically aren't a "hard down-select", meaning that non-invited vendors can usually request the RFP. However, if the customer uses this kind of mechanism, then it is certainly worth responding to such an RFI for subtle marketing, and perhaps more importantly the positive signal from the customer to partially validate our competitiveness.

## Influence an RFP Contents

For high-priority opportunities that we definitely hope to pursue, RFIs can be a way to inluence the RFP contents. Sometimes general input is solicitied, and sometimes an RFI may include a draft SOO/SOW/RFP for explicitly solicited input. This can be a way to provide input to the government on making the scope and competition as good as possible.
