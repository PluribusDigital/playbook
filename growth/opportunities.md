# Opportunity Tracking

This guide documents the Pluribus Digital process and principles for tracking and pursing business opportunities.

## Opportunity Funnel

The below diagram outlines how we track opportunities. This is broken down into 3 major states for a given opportunity, along with actions taken to move opportunities to the next state.

![process overview of opportunity funnel](/images/opp-funnel.png)

* __Identify:__ A new opportunity comes to our attention and begins to be tracked at a high-level.

  * _Validate_ identified opportunities to determine if they are worth pursuing.
  
  * _Reject_ opportunities that are clearly a poor fit from validation.

  * _Hold_ opportunities for which we don't have enough information to properly validate, and revisit them after a time period (usually 3-6 months).

* __Pursue:__ After validating that the opportunity is a strong enough fit, we decide to invest the effort to prepare for and shape the opportunity.

  * Form or seek a team.

  * Market to the relevant customer stakeholders.

  * Research customer needs.

  * When the RFP is released, come to a bid/no-bid decision.

* __Bid:__ When an opportunity has an active RFP (or perhaps draft RFP with a high-confidence schedule), it goes into an active state of preparing the proposal.

  * Carry out the [proposal development process](/topics/proposal.html).

## Identification

### Sources

* __Proactive Relationship Management (best source):__
  * Collaborative shaping of innovative solutions for a given customer
  * Insight into upcoming opportunities based on relationships and communication with target customers

* __GovWin:__
  * _Shared searches_ allow us to get the same alerts for all GovWin users
  * _Ad Hoc searching_ and personal searches

* __eBuy:__
  * Login to eBuy at least 2x/week to look for new opportunities or updates

* __Other:__
  * Customer conversations and relationships
  * Teaming partner conversations
  * ... etc.

### Identification Checklist

Once identified, an opportunity should be:

- [ ] Marked in GovWin (if it exists in GovWin) and add note as to "why"
- [ ] Added to our opportunity tracking sharepoint list
- [ ] Shared via email/slack to the BD team for awareness with a description and link to relevant info (this also tees the item up for discussion in the BD meeting)

## Validation

We research opportunities and validate them against set criteria in order to aid the decision to Pursue or Bid.

### Process

1. _Score_ the opportunity as best we can against the validation criteria.
2. _Note the confidence_ of our rating (based on how good our intel is).
3. _Create and assign actions_ if the opportunity is potentially a strong fit but we have information gaps that can be filled by proactive research.

### Validation Criteria Checklist

* __FIT__ - We are only so big, and can only track a targeted portion of the market. Does the client, mission, and scope of work fit our own mission and service areas? Is this work we will be proud to share?
  - [ ] Mission alignment
  - [ ] Target client
  - [ ] Focus service area / technology
  - [ ] Comparable qualifications
* __ACCESS__ - Do we have the necessary hard quals?
  - [ ] Contract vehicle
  - [ ] Clearance requirements
  - [ ] Set-aside 
* __INSIGHT__ - If we don’t understand the customer and environment, it is hard to put in a great proposal. Do we have relationships and points of contact at the agency? Have we had some engagement with the customer? 
  - [ ] We have relationships/PoCs
* __COMPETITION__ - If the playing field isn’t level, we aren’t likely to play. Is the opportunity “wired” for a certain firm, or is incumbency a major advantage for other reasons.
  - [ ] No favored incumbent
  - [ ] Small business preference/set-aside
* __PRICING__ - In order to bring the right talent, properly invest in our employees, and stay salary-competitive over time, we need a reasonable rate structure to work under. Is the evaluation criteria focused on capability or price? Is this in danger of being a “price shootout” or being procured as LPTA?
  - [ ] Not price shootout or LPTA
  - [ ] Not blind FFP (high pricing risk)

## Bid/No-bid

To make the bid/no-bid decision, we need to determine if the opportunity has the potential to pay off compared to the necessary effort.

The value of an opportunity is based on the __expected value calculation__ (probability x estimated value) rather than simply the _probability to win_.

## Bid Checklist

- [ ] __Re-validation__: Update the validation checklist with any new information.

- [ ] __Probability to Win__: Based on the competitive landscape, what are our chances (<5%, 10-25%, 50%, 75+%)?

- [ ] __Value__: How much is it worth to us if we win?
  - _Great work:_ is this a mission and scope of work that aligns to our purpose? Will we be proud to talk about the work?
  - _Expected profit:_ consider both the estimated revenue, as well as potential profit margin (usually rate structure/rate competitiveness)
  - _Growth potential:_ is this the foot in the door for a new client, or an opportunity with substantial likelihood of follow-on work?
  - _Prime/Sub:_ prime opportunities (including CTA member, JV member) are far more attractive than work as a sub.

- [ ] __Effort__: What will it cost us in terms of time, focus, energy, etc.
  - Are there parallel efforts going on competing for resources?
  - Will we need to spend money on external consultants to get it done?

## Teaming

We typically pursue opportunities as part of a team of firms. This allows us to bring a larger set of capabilities and capacity to better serve a customer.

### Prefer Trusted Teaming Partners

_We highly prefer to work with firms we know._ Although a "marriage of convenience" may look good on paper, working with an unproven partner adds cost and uncertainty to the proposal process, and may add delivery risk. Trust amplifies our efficiency and effectiveness. If we are beginning a new teaming relationship, we must look extra closely at the fit and validation items below.

### Team Fit Checklist

For a given opportunity, a team member must provide some value to the opportunity via one or more of the following qualities. Each quality should benefit the eventual _delivery_ and tie to proposal _evaluation crtieria_.

- [ ] Cultural focus on _delivery quality_ and _purpose_ is consistent with our own
- [ ] Add _delivery capabilities or capacity_ that we lack, or that would reduce delivery risk
- [ ] Bring _customer relationships and insights_ that allow us to craft a better fitting solution for the customer
- [ ] Bring specific relevant _past performance_ or _corporate experience_
- [ ] Can provide _key personnel_

### Prospective Team Member Validation Checklist

Before entering into any teaming agreement, we must perform some basic validation of the team member in addition to the strategic questions above.

- [ ] Check [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov) to confirm status of firm, particularly any negative filings
- [ ] Check with professional networks (e.g. mine common LinkedIn connections) to ideally find someone who has worked with the firm before
- [ ] Do basic web searching to make sure there are no major public issues
