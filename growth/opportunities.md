# Opportunity Tracking

This guide documents the Pluribus Digital process and principles for tracking and pursing business opportunities.

## Opportunity Funnel

The below diagram outlines how we track opportunities. This is broken down into 3 major activities for a given opportunity, along with several states in which the opportunities may reside.

![Opportunity Tracking Process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f9f1dd9-0f0c-47e4-aa4c-a2fceca5bd33)


* __Search:__ A new opportunity comes to our attention and begins to be tracked at a high-level. An opportunity may come to our attention as a result of a published [RFI](RFIs.md) or searching databases & official sources (eBuy, Sam.gov, eGOS, etc.). We also collect intel from customer engagement and outreach (i.e., discussions with target customers, events, teaming partners).

* __Score:__ Score opportunities per our criteria (see opp. scoring), then decide to move to ‘Watch’, ‘Pursuit’, or ‘Rejected’ based on how it lines up.

* __Pursue:__ After validating that the opportunity is a strong enough fit, we decide to invest the effort to prepare for and shape the opportunity. This involves gaining additional insight, forming a winning team, etc.

* __Respond:__ When an opportunity has an active RFP (or perhaps draft RFP with a high-confidence schedule), it goes into an active state of preparing the [proposal](proposals.md).

### Scoring Approach

We score opportunities by looking at a number of factors that roll up to three basic criteria:

1. Does it FIT our company vision and strategy?
2. Can we WIN based on the procurement approach?
3. Can we DELIVER at very hight quality if we win?

## Bid/No-bid

To make the bid/no-bid decision, we need to determine if the opportunity has the potential to pay off compared to the necessary effort.

The value of an opportunity is based on the __expected value calculation__ (probability x estimated value) rather than simply the _probability to win_.

## Bid Checklist

- [ ] __Re-validation__: Update the validation checklist with any new information.

- [ ] __Probability to Win__: Based on the competitive landscape, what are our chances (<5%, 10-25%, 50%, 75+%)?

- [ ] __Value__: How much is it worth to us if we win?
  - _Great work:_ is this a mission and scope of work that aligns to our purpose? Will we be proud to talk about the work?
  - _Expected profit:_ consider both the estimated revenue, as well as potential margin (usually rate structure/rate competitiveness)
  - _Growth potential:_ is this the foot in the door for a new client, or an opportunity with substantial likelihood of follow-on work?
  - _Prime/Sub:_ prime opportunities (including CTA member, JV member) are generally more attractive than work as a sub.

- [ ] __Effort__: What will it cost us in terms of time, focus, energy, etc.
  - Are there parallel efforts going on competing for resources?
  - Will we need to spend money on external consultants to get it done?

## Teaming

We typically pursue opportunities as part of a team of firms. This allows us to bring a larger set of capabilities and capacity to better serve a customer.

### Prefer Trusted Teaming Partners

_We highly prefer to work with firms we know._ Although a "marriage of convenience" may look good on paper, working with an unproven partner adds cost and uncertainty to the proposal process, and may add delivery risk. Trust amplifies our efficiency and effectiveness. If we are beginning a new teaming relationship, we must look extra closely at the fit and validation items below.

### Team Fit Checklist

For a given opportunity, a team member must provide some value to the opportunity via one or more of the following qualities. Each quality should benefit the eventual _delivery_ and tie to proposal _evaluation crtieria_.

- [ ] Cultural focus on _delivery quality_ and _purpose_ is consistent with our own
- [ ] Add _delivery capabilities or capacity_ that we lack, or that would reduce delivery risk
- [ ] Bring _customer relationships and insights_ that allow us to craft a better fitting solution for the customer
- [ ] Bring specific relevant _past performance_ or _corporate experience_
- [ ] Can provide _key personnel_

### Prospective Team Member Validation Checklist

Before entering into any teaming agreement, we must perform some basic validation of the team member in addition to the strategic questions above.

- [ ] Check [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov) to confirm status of firm, particularly any negative filings
- [ ] Check with professional networks (e.g. mine common LinkedIn connections) to ideally find someone who has worked with the firm before
- [ ] Perform a due dilligence web search to make sure there are no major public issues
