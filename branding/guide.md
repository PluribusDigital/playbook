# Brand Guide & Voice

We project a consistent, authentic voice as we communicate externally or internally. This guide empowers individuals to write while staying true to our shared identity.

Our tone may change when we’re speaking to different audiences. A tone range helps to determine the levels of formality and familiarity we should be using for any written content. 

We don’t change our core voice attributes (who we are) based on audience or medium, but we will adjust tone (style and level of detail).

## Who We Are

### Usage & Variations

**Pluribus Digital, Inc.** is the name by which we officially do business. There are some variations of that which are acceptable, and some that are not.

_:heavy_check_mark: Acceptable Variations:_

* Pluribus Digital (normal full name without the "inc." formality)
* Pluribus (short version for repeated use in a document)
* Pluribus Digital, Inc. d.b.a. Solution Technology Systems, Inc. (long form official name including DBA for some legal contexts - if it is important to tie our identity to work done under our former name)

_:x: Unacceptable Variations:_

* PD
* PluribusDigital
* PluribusDigital.com (except when referring to the web URL/URI)

### Archetype

Pluribus is the hands-on doer of transformation.

The government is changing how they support their mission, and need the capacity to get it done. We directly impact the mission with delivery of government services in the form of great digital products. We use action to speak for us as much as words or vision. We are the ones who show up when it counts – for our customers, our employees, or our communities. We roll up our sleeves and get to work.

### Voice: Attributes

Attributes are the key personality traits we want to convey, or how others would describe us. In our written content, we should come across as purposeful, committed, inclusive, authentic, and curious. 

#### Committed and purpose-driven

We support public service missions because we believe that is the most impactful way to apply our talents. There’s lots of other valuable work in the world, but we are committed to the missions we serve. We are a mature and reliable partner to those missions. 

* We highlight the impact of the work we do, and our part in it, connecting it back to public service and societal good.
* We are excited to work on these problems! Not everyone gets to have such purpose and impact in their work. We’re grateful we do, and happy to share that enthusiasm.
* Let the broader purpose seep into content. For example, basic procedures in an employee handbook can be framed in giving people the tools and support they need to support the mission.
* Even if we place a high value on our work, we don’t need to put down other types of work. We can always highlight the positive impact of what we do, and it’s perfectly OK to show our pride in the unique purpose and impact.

#### Inclusive and welcoming

We invite others into the conversation with accessible language, and themes that invite them to share our purpose. Content should be accessible to people of any background. Text describing our work, approach, or accomplishments invites people of any technical knowledge to understand it.

* Drive out jargon. If an industry term is useful, use a phrase to explain it in plain language and/or link to another resource that describes it. Assume your audience lacks inside knowledge. Colloquially, some use the phrase “Explain it to an 8th grader” or a parent/grandparent (though many 8th graders or grandparents are pretty sharp on these topics).
* Write to real people, not to the idea of formal business writing. Recognize that, as a professional services business, we are entirely comprised of real live thinking and feeling people – as are our customer organizations. 
* Avoid macho tone or gendered language. We are a woman-owned and heavily women-led company after all. Don’t be afraid to show ‘feminine’ traits such as compassion or collaboration.
* Avoid language of conflict, violence or war. 
* We employ people not “resources.” We don’t employ ninjas, rock stars, etc.
* We are proud of the talented people we employ, but are not elite or dismissive of what other organizations might contribute.

#### Authentic in a buzz-fueled industry

We apply modern technology and ways of working. We don’t need to chase or parrot every buzzword to sound smart. We do what is effective and a fit for our customers. It’s OK if we’re not working on a blockchain solution – we’re not falling behind.

* Frame technology or solutions in terms of connection to purpose and mission.
* We are not experts in every buzzword technology, and don’t want to be. We do employ talented people that can help a customer reason through which technology is a fit for what they are trying to accomplish.
* Do share stories of how exciting emerging technology has helped a customer mission. If a reader isn’t familiar with that tech, bring them along. If we can’t explain in plain language, we probably don’t understand it as well as we imagined.
* Don’t share articles on social media that are simply trying to show alignment to new trends.
* Use facts and verifiable statements over superlatives. We have helped government agencies use the cloud, but we aren’t claiming industry-leading cloud expertise. 

#### Genuinely curious and driven to improve

We learn, explore, and improve. We are excited to share insights based on real experience. We engage in technical communities. We experiment with technologies. In our customer work, we strive to discover the best solution by working shoulder-to-shoulder with our customers.

* Highlight tangible experience and lessons from first-hand experience.
* Recognize our humanity, and the fact that mistakes and course corrections are part of our work. Acknowledge mistakes or fault, and share how we learn from them. 
* Some vulnerability is OK - we aren’t all-knowing experts that come in with the only right answer.

## Tone: How We Talk

The voice (above) is who we are – our personality – which is consistent across any content. The tone may change per situation and audience.

### Formality

* _Conversational:_ the goal is to establish a human connection and get across excitement and cultural feel as much as raw content. Bring the reader in with second-person (“you”), and engage them in a way similar to writing an email explaining the same information to a friend. We can afford to be a little cute. Don’t commit grave grammar mistakes, but do feel free to take some license in phrasing for the sake of rhythm and flow.
* _Formal:_ the goal is to show respect to a process or audience that demands it. Stick to the third person and more formal rules of grammar. Still favor direct and concise over verbose, stuffy, or flowery language.

### Depth

* _High-level:_ understand what the reader wants to know, and distill the message down to what is relevant. Stick to basic take-aways or “so what.” If some technical explanation is necessary, keep it simple, brief, and jargon free. It’s OK to use unsupported claims, so long as claims are true and supportable.
* _Detailed:_ get into the weeds to provide a detailed case or detailed instructions. Walk through the nitty-gritty of what and how. Explain why the content is beneficial. Support claims with evidence. Show code samples, or share a story that helps to explain. Do provide a good organizational structure so readers can skip through areas where they don’t want the detail – or so they can easily find a relevant section. 

### Tone per channel

* _General Web Content:_ conversational, high-level. The web site is for people to understand what we’re about and who we are. Readers need to get the basic take-aways they are looking for, while also getting a flavor for what it’s like on the inside.
* _Job Postings:_ conversational, detailed. Candidates need to get a feel if a job is a long-term fit for them. We need to convey the human connection, and they need lots of meaty details about the day to day responsibilities. Write like you are creating an email to a valued former colleague trying to let them know everything they would need in order to understand what the job is about. Most job postings in the world could be better. Let’s try to do better with each one.
* _News:_ formal, high-level. We don’t do true press releases, but our news items are relatively dry facts – a place for updates. They can be short and to the point.
* _Blog:_ informal, high-level or low-level. Content can vary, and can be more opinionated. We may share very in-the-weeds knowledge or opinions. There is some freedom in the blog posts in tone, so long as we stay true to the voice and attributes.
* _Email:_ informal, high-level. We are pushing out information that we think people need. People get a lot of email, so even if detail is warranted, try to at least provide a high-level summary with detail further in the message, or as a link/attachment.
* _Twitter:_ informal, high-level. Followers have an interest in seeing what we’re up to. Content should be about sharing what we’re doing (events, news, hiring, etc.). We can also share stories to push the broader mission/importance of public purpose digital transformation. Keep it positive and relevant, and of course very brief.
* _LinkedIn:_ semi-formal, high-level. The comments on Twitter apply with a couple of minor exceptions. LinkedIn allows longer posts, so we can have a short lead-in with more content “below the fold.” Also, the audience tends to be a little less tech focused and a bit more formal. 
* _Proposal:_ formal, detailed. Proposal evaluators want us to respect the process, and the need for review. We can let our passion and personality come through, but the language should respect the importance and objectivity of the process. We need to provide adequate detail to prove that we are up to the task.
