## Logos

### Logo Usage Guidelines

* _Do not change the logo._ Do not edit, re-arrange, re-color, change part of the text portion, etc. Do not change the aspect ratio (width as compared to height).

* _Use an appropriate file type for the medium._  Use vector formats (SVG) when possible. Use an appropriate resolution raster format (PNG) otherwise. Avoid pixelation or blurring by not using a too-small file.

* _Use an appropriate background color._ The color logo is meant to be set on very light (white or close) or very dark (black or close) backgrounds. The single-color versions can be used in a wider variety of backgrounds.
